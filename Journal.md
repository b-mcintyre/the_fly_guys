JD: Why is journal empty?

began with calculating the means, standard deviations, coefficients of variations, indviduals counts, and levene's statistic for grouped Allele_1 and wild type background

created two sepearate data frames with the two differet allelic series of bx and sd

plotted the sd vs the means for each of the grouped lines

can maybe fit a quadratic model to the model? - as talked to by BB

Goal --> find the different between individuals within group/line variabilites   (sd) (commonly called within individual variation)
SEE if there is genetic variation(or change in sd) in how much variation(sd) there is in among those individuals within group/lines 
Does variability or (more standard deviations on standard deviations) increase on mutants with moderate phenotypic effects? 


i.e. 1) measure change in mean between environments(mutations): go from OREw --> sd58d how the line means change
<<<<<<< HEAD
2) measure change in standard deviation between environments: go from OREw --> sd58d how does the line standard deviations change

looking at variation between individuals within lines/genotypes
looking at variation between lines 

utilize median form of levene's statistic to give a measurement of variability among individuals who are genetically similar
can utilize means and standard deviation to see how among/between line means

Fixed effects = mutants (x9)
random effects = DGRP lines (x20) and replicate blocks (x3)
