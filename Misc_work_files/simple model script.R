#Simple model fit 

#biologcial question focuses on reaction norm of the mean
#do the means become more variable i.e. does the residual variation increase in the intercepts or the means
#of the different lines in different genetic enviornments, with predicting that the intercepts do increase
#with regards to sd[E3] and sd[ETX4] relative to the others
#will be able to see if there is a correlation of this between the two via a correlation plot
#maybe can plot these values and see it

#also could do this with lev_stat and see the results 


#fixed vs random effects:
#control for non-independence, created from nested or hierarchical structure where don't care about the factor
#it's self but want to account for potential differences between the groups treat it as a random effect
#Fixed effects = parameters you are interested in
